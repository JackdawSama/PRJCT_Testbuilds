## Known Issues

* Dashing as a movement isn't responsive but Weapon System is responsive so ammo add is registered.
* Holding down fire continuously empties ammo without pausing between every shell.
* L.Shift spamming allows for single dash movement-wise but multiple Kinetic Shells are added to the player magazine.
